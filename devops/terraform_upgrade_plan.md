# Terraform Upgrade Plan for Large Codebases

This document outlines an approach for upgrading Terraform across large, multi-team infrastructure codebases.

---

## 1. Preparation Phase

### Gradual Update
- Upgrade incrementally to reduce the risk of compatibility issues. Avoid skipping major Terraform versions.

### Inventory & Categorization
- List all modules (internal and external).
- Define ownership, environment, usage, and current versions.

### Audit & Compatibility Check
- Carefully review the release notes for breaking changes and deprecations.
- Identify modules needing version bumps or refactoring.

### Lock Down State
- Backup remote or local state.
- Ensure versioning and encryption is enabled for remote backends (e.g., S3).

### Lock Dependency Versions
- Pin providers and module versions to keep consistency.
- Use `terraform providers lock` to regenerate `.terraform.lock.hcl`.
- Commit lock files to version control.

---

## 2. Planning & Staging Phase

### Create an Upgrade Branch
- Use a branch like `terraform-upgrade-vX.Y`.
- Communicate across teams and environments.

### Upgrade CLI & Tools
- Update Terraform CLI and `required_versions` in Terraform configuration.
- Update Provider and module versions as needed.
- Reinitialize the environment by running `terraform init`.


### Plan Review & Validation
- Run `terraform plan` per module â€” expect no unintended changes.
- Validate with `terraform validate`, `tflint`, `checkov`, etc.
- Document changes.

### Code Updates
- Refactor deprecated syntax.
- Adjust for breaking changes.

---

## 3. Execution Phase

### Deployment Plan
- Define deployment steps, timelines, and owners.
- Call out risks to uptime and performance.

### Staged Rollouts
- Start with lower environments or non-critical modules.
- Deploy by team/module to isolate failure domains.

### Drift Detection
- Run `terraform plan` post-apply to detect drift.
- Use tools like `terraform state list`, `infracost`, etc.

---

## 4. Finalization Phase

### Validation & Monitoring
- Run smoke/integration tests.
- Monitor infrastructure behavior and availability.

### Cleanup
- Remove deprecated or transitional code.

### Document Results
- Log final versions, known issues, and solutions.
- Update READMEs and module docs.
- Capture metrics on rollout time, stability, failures, etc.

### Postmortem
Host a structured retrospective:
- What was done?
- What went wrong?
- Potential process gaps.
- Improvements for the next upgrade cycle.

---

## Additional Notes

### Infrastructure Code Testing
Automated tests and validation steps should be added to deployment pipelines to prevent regressions.

### Optional Tools

| Category    | Tools |
|-------------|-------|
| CI/CD       | Atlantis, Spacelift, Terragrunt |
| Testing     | Kitchen-Terraform, Terratest |
| Validation  | Pre-commit hooks, `terraform show -json | jq` |
